## High Concept Statement

In Caravan Conquest, players embark on an adventurous journey across a vibrant,
tile-based map filled with diverse terrains and hidden treasures. Each player
controls a caravan that carries valuable goods and gold, racing against opponents
to reach a designated destination first. Along the way, players will encounter
various challenges and opportunities, such as trading posts, ambushes from bandits,
and mystical events that can either bolster their resources or deplete them.

As players traverse the map, they must strategically manage their inventory of goods,
balancing the need for speed with the desire to collect as many valuable items
as possible. The game features a dynamic trading system where players can exchange
goods for gold at specific locations, with the value of goods diminishing for those
who arrive after the first player reaches the finish. This creates a sense of
urgency and competition, forcing players to make tactical decisions about when
to trade and when to press forward.

The game includes elements of resource management, where players can upgrade their
caravans and animals to enhance capacity or speed, making each turn crucial for long-term
strategy. The rich interactions and varying encounters ensure that no two games
are the same, promoting replayability and strategic depth.

## Core Mechanics

* **Turn progression** through moving around the map and triggering encounters,
                       trading, etc.
* **Equipment upgrade** in cities.
* **Resource trading** in trade camps.

## Feature Set

**Tile-based map:**

* The game map is built from tiles of multiple types.
* Each map tile represents a different environment, with its own effects and encounters.
* The map can be different for each game, making it necessary for players to try
  and adopt different strategies.

**Resource management:**

* There are three main resources: Gold, Spice and Silk. Both Spice and Silk have
  a different value in Gold
* The player's caravan has limited capacity, forcing the player to trade and strategize.
* It is possible to upgrade the caravan and its draft animals by trading.

**Equipment:**

* **The caravan** - Determines the player's carry capacity.
* **Draft animals** - Affect the player's movement speed per turn.

**Randomized encounters:**

* Each tile type has its own encounters that are triggered when the player ends their
  turn there, with positive or negative effects, that can help turn the game around.

**Treasure:**

* The players can race to be the first to acquire the treasure, which is worth
  a large amount of gold. The ownership of the treasure can be game-deciding

**The race element:**

* The game is driven by the urge to reach the finish tile first. After the first
  player reaches the finish, all other players' goods start to lose their gold value
  turn by turn

**The Travelling Merchant's Ledger:**

* Every resource and stat can be calculated by hand and using physical tokens,
  but for players who would prefer this to be automized, there is [an application
  for this purpose](https://sevcak.github.io/caravan-conquest-boardgame/ledger/).

## Player experience goals

* **Competitivness:** The player wants to be the first and the most wealthy
* **High stakes:** Even the very first turns are important to victory, forcing
                   the player to think long-term from the start.
* **Novelty:** The game is randomized, so the player cannot choose the same approach
               every playthrough.

## Development roles

* **Design**
* **Art**
  * 2D Art assets
  * 3D Models for printed assets
* **Playtesting**

## Competition

While we could see all existing board games as competitors, games that place their
focus on resource management and travel are the biggest competition.

The most similar game to Caravan Conquest is Catan, however its map is smaller
and the players are more static. Both games have their differences that make them
very different.

Another strong competitor could be Everdell, however this game also doesn't have
any world travel mechanic.
